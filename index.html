    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
         I was born on July 17, 1982 in Elyria, Oh. Always a curious child and competitive, I always grew up trying to be the best version of myself.
         As I've grown older and wiser I'm beginning to realize that we as humans are full of such potential. Reaching the best version of ourselves would be 
         an impossible task. I took all of my ambition and ended becoming a National Wrestling Champion only after a short period of entering the sport as 
         a teenager. That soon transitioned into a career of traveling all over the country and being invited onto the global stage to perform in wrestling 
         matches a sports ambassador for the U.S.A. After high school I joined the United States Marine Corps where shortly after I would find myself fighting the 
         war on Baghdad in 2003 and the Battle of Fallujah in 2004. I got out of the Marine Corps in 2005. My story seems to be one of brute strength and force 
         but deep down I have always had a strong curiosity about computer programming. I've always known that the mind is much stronger than the body. I'm ready
         to lead by example for my two small children and show them that it's never too late in life to pursue your goals.
